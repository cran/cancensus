[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cancensus)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cancensus)

Access, retrieve, and work with Canadian Census data and geography. 

* Download data and Census geography in tidy and analysis-ready format
* Convenience tools for searching for and working with Census regions and variable hierarchies
* Provides Census geography in multiple R spatial formats
* Provides data and geography at multiple Census geographic levels including province, Census Metropolitan Area, Census Division, Census Subdividision, Census Tract, and Dissemination Areas
* Provides up-to-date data for the 2016, 2011, and 2006 Censuses

### Reference

[**Cancensus home page and reference guide**](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html)

### Installing the package

```
install.packages("cancensus")
library(cancensus)
```

Alternatively, the latest development version can be installed from Github.
```
devtools::install_github("mountainmath/cancensus")
library(cancensus)
```

### API key

This package relies on queries to the CensusMapper API, which requires a Censusmapper API key. You can obtain a free API key by [signing up](https://censusmapper.ca/users/sign_up) for a CensusMapper account. CensusMapper API keys are free; however, API requests are limited in volume. For larger quotas, please get in touch with Jens [directly](mailto:jens@censusmapper.ca).  

To check your API key, just go to "Edit Profile" (in the top-right of the CensusMapper menu bar). Once you have your key, you can store it in your system environment so it is automatically used in API calls. To do so just enter `options(cancensus.api_key = "your_api_key")`.

### Local Cache

For performance reasons, and to avoid unneccessarily drawing down API quotas, **cancensus** caches data queries under the hood. By default, **cancensus** caches in R's temporary directory, but this cache is not persistent across sessions. In order to speed up performance, reduce quota usage, and reduce the need for unnecessary network calls, we recommend assigning a persistent local cache using `options(cancensus.cache_path = 'XXX')`, this enables better control over the data. This option can be stored stored in your .Rprofile alongside your API key. Users will be prompted with a suggestion to change their default cache location when making API calls if one has not been set yet. 

### Currently available datasets

**cancensus** can access Statistics Canada Census data for the 2006 Census, the 2011 Census and National Household Survey, as well as the latest available data from the 2016 Census. You can run `list_census_datasets` to check what datasets are currently available for access through the CensusMapper API. Additional data for the 2016 Census will be included in Censusmapper within a day or two after public release by Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada maintains a release schedule for the Census 2016 Program which can be viewed on their [website](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/release-dates-diffusion-eng.cfm).

### Picking regions and variables

Census data contains thousands of different geographic regions as well as thousands of unique variables. There are several useful functions within **cancensus** to simplify accessing Census metadata, locating regions, and identifying variables.

```
# To view available Census datasets
list_census_datasets()

# To view available named regions at different levels of Census hierarchy for the 2016 Census (for example)
list_census_regions("CA16")

# To view available Census variables for the 2016 Census
list_census_vectors("CA16")
```

There is also an interactive tool that is available at [CensusMapper API call generator](https://censusmapper.ca/api) to visually select regions and variables and generate code for the API call.

### Getting the data

**cancensus** can return census data with or without associated Census geographical information that can be used for mapping and GIS. By default, **cancensus** returns tidy tabular data only, but has options to return spatial data objects in either [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) or [**sp**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp) formats. 
```
# Return data only
census_data <- get_census(dataset='CA16', regions=list(CMA="59933"), vectors=c("v_CA16_408","v_CA16_409","v_CA16_410"), level='CSD')

# Return an sf-class data frame
census_data <- get_census(dataset='CA16', regions=list(CMA="59933"), vectors=c("v_CA16_408","v_CA16_409","v_CA16_410"), level='CSD', geo_format = "sf")

# Return a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
census_data <- get_census(dataset='CA16', regions=list(CMA="59933"), vectors=c("v_CA16_408","v_CA16_409","v_CA16_410"), level='CSD', geo_format = "sp")
```
**cancensus** attempts to minimize bandwidth usage and download time by caching downloads. When attempting to download data that has previously been downloaded,  **cancensus** will instead access the locally cached equivalent.
